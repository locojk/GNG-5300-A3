# Shopping Assistant with LangGraph

## Overview
This project is a Shopping Assistant developed using LangChain, LangGraph, and a local language model (LLM). The assistant can handle various shopping-related queries, manage a shopping cart, and provide information on product availability, recommendations, delivery estimates, and payment options.

The assistant is built using tools for interacting with a local SQLite database and handle sensitive operations (like adding/removing items from the cart) by requiring user confirmation.
